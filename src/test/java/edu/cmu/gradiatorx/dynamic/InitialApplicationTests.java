 * for testing, including all auto-configuration, component scanning, and
 * dependency injection that would occur in a production environment.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These tests are essential for catching configuration errors, missing
 * dependencies, or circular dependency issues early in the development cycle.</p>

     * Test that verifies the Spring Boot application context loads successfully.
     * 
     * <p>This test ensures that:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>All required beans can be instantiated</li>
     *   <li>Component scanning discovers all necessary components</li>
     *   <li>Auto-configuration classes are properly applied</li>
     *   <li>Dependency injection resolves all dependencies</li>
     *   <li>Configuration properties are loaded correctly</li>
     *   <li>No circular dependencies exist</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>The test passes simply by having the application context load without
     * throwing any exceptions. If there are configuration issues, missing
     * dependencies, or bean creation problems, this test will fail with
     * descriptive error messages.</p>
     * 
     * <p>This is particularly important for validating:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Docker client initialization</li>
     *   <li>Google Cloud Pub/Sub client setup</li>
     *   <li>Service layer dependency injection</li>
     *   <li>Configuration property binding</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @throws Exception if the application context fails to load due to
     *                   configuration errors, missing dependencies, or
     *                   initialization failures
