/**
 * Utility class for handling ZIP file operations in the submission processing workflow.
 * 
 * <p>This class provides functionality for saving submission ZIP files to disk with
 * unique naming based on submission IDs. The design supports concurrent processing
 * by ensuring each submission has its own uniquely named file, preventing conflicts
 * between simultaneous submissions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The class follows a strategy where ZIP files are saved to disk but not extracted
 * immediately. Instead, the ZIP files are later mounted into Docker containers where
 * extraction happens in an isolated environment.</p>
 * 
 * <p>All methods in this class are static, making it a pure utility class without
 * any instance state.</p>
