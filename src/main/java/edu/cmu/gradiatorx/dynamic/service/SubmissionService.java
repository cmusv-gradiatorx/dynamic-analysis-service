/**
 * Service class for handling submission processing logic with concurrent support.
 *
 * <p>This service orchestrates the complete submission processing workflow using
 * Java-based Docker and PubSub services. It provides per-submission isolation
 * to ensure multiple submissions can be processed concurrently without conflicts.</p>
 *
 * <p>The processing workflow includes:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Receiving and validating PubSub payloads</li>
 *   <li>Saving ZIP files with unique submission-based naming</li>
 *   <li>Building Docker images for the analysis environment</li>
 *   <li>Running isolated containers with mounted submission files</li>
 *   <li>Collecting and processing container execution results</li>
 *   <li>Publishing results to Google Cloud PubSub topics</li>
 *   <li>Cleaning up temporary files and resources</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The service is designed for high concurrency and fault tolerance, with
 * comprehensive error handling and resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
 * and resource exhaustion.</p>
